# Skyscanner | Frontend Software Engineering VirtualExperience Programme

This was my first Forage Virtual Experience Programme where I simulated a real world task from a Skyscanner Frontend Engineer. I decided to complete it mainly out of curiosity, as well as to understand what a real-world Frontend Engineer task might look like.

I had a chance to familiarise myself with Skyscanner's Backpack Webpack and refresh SASS skills. Although they suggested using class components, I decided to use functional components.

## For Developers

`backpack-react-scripts` is listed as a `devDependency` in [package.json](./package.json) and exposes the following npm scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will see the build errors in the console.
- `npm test`: Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changes since the last commit.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
